Stage engine actor implementation
=======

Stage is an experiment in creating a small, proof-of-concept game engine using actor-based parallelization. Since the engine was created for a master's thesis written at a Finnish university, all of the code comments are currently in Finnish (sorry, non-Finns!).

Uses the Stage common library at https://github.com/DocV/Stage_common
